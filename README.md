### <div align="center">Hi there, I'm Aitana (just Aitana), a technical support professional with a passion for programming and continuous learning. 🖥️ My journey into computing began in the 1990s with MSDOS, where I explored technology on my own. Back then, computing was seen as a male-dominated field, which led me to pursue a support role rather than a more technical one.

Over the years, I’ve gained experience across a variety of technology areas, developing a broad skill set. While I’ve yet to specialize in one field, my hands-on approach has given me valuable insights into many aspects of tech. 🧑‍💻

Since 2020, I’ve worked remotely, refining my skills through trial and error and reverse engineering. I may have some unconventional solutions in my repositories, but they reflect my unique approach to learning. I’m now looking for a mentor to help guide me into a Junior Developer role. 🚀

My Skill Set:
Linux, Git Bash, Styled Components, Android, React, CSS3, HTML5, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, MySQL, Node.js, Adobe InDesign, Power BI, Salesforce, WordPress, jQuery, GitLab, Material UI.
